# One-Shot Learning with Deep Learning

## Introduction
This project implements **One-Shot Learning** using deep learning techniques. It leverages **ResNet18 with Spatial Group-wise Enhancements (SGE)** for feature extraction and employs metric learning strategies such as **Triplet Loss**. The training process includes both classification-based pretraining and metric-based fine-tuning.
